DORSET'S BANK

Theo Midavaine 24452

This program has been coded in C# in visual studio, as in the instructions i've done a menu in which we have bank employee view and customer view.
I've tried to do every function required in the assessment, as per coding requirment i didnt use interface nor inheriance i do not master these part of c#.

Everything works, i didnt find any shocking exception during test phase it might bug if the user input totally wrong info (special characters eg). 
I tried to do a menu as user friendly as can be everything is written, I thought to do a true menu with WPF but in the end its easier to code like that.

I didnt comment very much but i think most of it is self explanatory, also i tried to name my function the clearest way possible.

Commands.menu(bank) is the commands used to open and modify the bank. 

Commands.Path() need to be changed so the user will have customers.txt and client files where he desires.
